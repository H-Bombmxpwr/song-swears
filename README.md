# song-swears
A local hosted website in python that takes in the name of a song and returns all the swears in it. The words.txt file is full of a list of local swear words
to compare between the songs lyrics and a database. Some of the words in there are not very friendly, so be warned opening and reading through it. 

This repository contains everything from the python on the backend, to the css at the frontend.
